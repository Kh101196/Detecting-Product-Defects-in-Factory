# A new data analyst intern are in charge of monitoring the number of defective products from a specific factory
# He has been told that the number of defects on a given day follows the Poisson distribution with the rate parameter (lambda) 
# You will help him to investigate certain attributes of the Poisson(lambda) distribution to get an intuition for how many defective objects he should expect to see in a given amount of time

# Create a variable called lam that represents the rate parameter
